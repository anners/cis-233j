/**
 * Class Room - a room in an adventure game.
 *
 * This was World of Zuul, now it is PubCrawl. Your goal is to drink beer at all the 
 *  pubs and get home with money still in your pocket. Beware not every place you go into is a pub. 
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
 * connected to other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled north, 
 * east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference
 * to the neighboring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction.
